\section{Operation}

Consider the operation
\[
\mbox{your operation}
\]
where ...
This is a special case of xxxx , 
with the xxx.
We will refer to this operation
as {\sc XXXX\_XX} where the {\sc XX} stands for
xxxx.


\section{Precondition and postcondition}

In the precondition 
\[
% insert precondition
\]
xxxx denotes the original contents of xxx.
This allows us to express the state upon completion, the postcondition, as
\[
% insert postcondition
\]
