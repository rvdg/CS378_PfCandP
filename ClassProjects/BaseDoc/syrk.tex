Symmetric rank-k update ({\sc Syrk}) 
is matrix-matrix multiplication of a matrix with its transpose, where the matrix $ C $ being updated is symmetric, stored in the lower or upper triangular part of the matrix.  

The full set of 
symmetric rank-k cases 
is denoted by {\sc Syrk\_$\Box \Box $}, 
where the letters in the two boxes denote whether the 
matrices begin multiplied are {\sc n}ot transposed or {\sc t}ranksposed, 
and whether the matrix being updated is stored in the 
{\sc l}ower or {\sc u}pper triangular part:
\[
\begin{array}{c |  c   |   c  | l |} \cline{2-4}
&  {\mbox{\sc n} \Box  }
&  {\mbox{\sc t} \Box  } 
&
\\ \cline{2-3}
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c |}{ \Box \mbox{\sc l}} & C := A A^T + C &
C := A^T A + C 
& \mbox{$ C $ symmetric, stored in lower triangle}\\
\hline
\multicolumn{1}{|c |}{ \Box \mbox{\sc u}} & C := A A^T + C &
C := A^T A + C 
& \mbox{$ C $ symmetric, stored in upper triangle}\\
\hline
\end{array}
